**5.1**  What is the largest unsigned integer that can be stored as a 16-bit number?

- 65,535

**5.2**  What does *BCD* stand for? Explain at least two important disadvantages of storing
numbers in BCD format. Offer one advantage for using a BCD format for storing

- Binary Coded Decimal
- You can store a lot less information
- Math is much more complicated than with binary numbers
- Much harder to accidentally mess up the information, very important for finance

**5.3**  Give an example that shows the disadvantage of using a sign-and-magnitude format
for manipulating signed integers.

- It’s more complex to implement in the computer hardware because of differing orders of signs while doing operations

**5.4**  What is a quick way to identify negative numbers when using 1’s complement
arithmetic?

- The first digit is 1

**5.5**  How do you change the sign of an integer stored in 1’s complement form? As an
example, the 8-bit representation for the value 19 is 00010011. What is the 1’s
complement representation for −19?

- You change the sign by inverting every digit.
- -19 in 1’s complement would be 11101100

**5.6**  How do you identify an *overflow* condition when you add two numbers in 1’s
complement form?

- If both signs are the same and the result is of a different sign, there’s an overflow.

**5.7**  Explain the procedure for adding two numbers in 1’s complement form. As an example,
convert +38 and −24 to 8-bit 1’s complement form and add them. Convert your result
back to decimal and confirm that your answer is correct.

- 38 is 00100110
- 24 is 00011000
- -24 is 11100111
- 38 + -24 is 00001101 + 1 = 00001110

**5.8**  If you see a 2’s complement number whose value is 11111110, what rough estimate
can you make about the number?

- It must be small because there’s a lot of 1s in front of it

**5.9**  How do you change the sign of an integer stored in 2’s complement form? As an
example, the 8-bit representation for the value 19 is 00010011. What is the 2’s
complement representation for −19?

- Take the 1s complement and add 1 to it.
- -19 in 1s complement is 11101100
- Add 1 to get 11101101 = -19

**5.10**  How do you detect overflow when adding two numbers in 2’s complement form?

- Overflows happen when the two operands are the same signs and the result is the opposite sign.

**5.11**  Explain the procedure for adding two numbers in 2’s complement form. As an example,
convert +38 and −24 to 8-bit 2’s complement form and add them. Convert your result back to decimal and confirm that your answer is correct.

- 38 is 00100110
- 24 is 00011000
- -24 in 1sc is 11100111
- -24 is 2sc is 11101000
- 0010-0110 + 1110-1000 = 1000-1110

**5.12**  What is the relationship between complementary representation and sign-and-magnitude representation for positive numbers?

- The first digit acts as the sign

**5.13**  Real numbers in a computer (or *float*, if you prefer), are most often represented in exponential notation. Four separate components are needed to represent numbers in this form. Identify each component in the number 1.2345 × 10^−5 . What is the advantage of this type of representation, rather than storing the number as 0.000012345?

- The advantage is accuracy and ease of calculations
- The sign of the number (positive)
- The mantissa, the magnitude of the number (1.2345)
- The sign of the exponent (negative)
- The magnitude of the exponent (5)
- The base (10)

**5.14**  To represent a number in exponential form in the computer, two additional assump-
tions must be made about the number. What are those assumptions?

- The base of the exponent and the location of the radix point.

**5.15**  Exponents are normally stored in *excess-N* notation. Explain excess-*N* notation. If a
number is stored in excess-31 notation and the actual exponent is 2^12, what value is
stored in the computer for the exponent?

- 43
- 00011011

**5.16**  When adding two floating point numbers, what must be true for the exponents of the
two numbers?

- They must be the same

**5.17**  The IEEE provides a standard 32-bit format for floating point numbers. The format
for a number is specified as ±1.M × 2^(*E* − *127)*. Explain each part of this format.

- ±1 - the sign
- .M - the mantissa
- x 2 (the base)
- ^ E-127 (an excess-127 formatted exponent)
