10.0 Introduction:

- Computers have peripherals
- Storage, graphics, displays, input, outputs
- Mobile devices have Accelerometers and gyroscopes
- Server grade peripherals are faster and more robust than consumer grade
- Categorized as input, output or storage

10.1 Hierarchy of storage:

- In order from fastest to slowest: CPU registers, cache, RAM, SSD, HDD, ODD, magnetic tape
- The faster you get, the less capacity you have
- Slower storage is cheaper, more readily available, comes in higher capacity, and non-volatile

10.2 Solid State Memory:

- flash memory is not fast enough to be used as RAM so it’s used for secondary storage
- low power requirement, faster and more efficient than spinning magnetic drives
- historically has been more expensive than magnetic storage, has come down in price
- organized into sequential blocks
- erase operation is leading cause of failure, so instead of erasing data we mark it as erased and write over it when the space is needed, causes less wear on the drive

10.3 Magnetic Disks:

- physical spinning magnetic platter that stores data with electromagnets switching bits
- Disk platters rotate, they have read/write heads to read the magnetic states and the data
- Sectors on a track contain a block of data, 512 or 4096 bytes
- Read/Write entire sectors at once for efficiency
- CAV - Motor always rotates at fixed speed, can’t efficiently use the outer edges of the platter
- CLV - To use the outer edges of the platter, the motor has to rotate slower on those outer edges to maintain a certain rate of reading data, effectively doubling the capacity of the platter
- Disks use zones divided into sectors to compromise between CAV and CLV

10.6 Displays:

- A rectangular device that emits light and shows images from a computer
- 4:3 is older and less used on computers, now you see it on iPads
- 16:9 is common widescreen, most laptops tvs and desktops are 16:9
- 16:10 is less common, historically used by apple but other laptop oems are starting to use this instead of 16:9
- 1280x720 and 1920x1080 are common 16:9 resolutions
- 2560x1440 is less common higher resolution
- The higher resolution the screen is, more dense in pixels, shows images more clearly
- A colour pixel is made up of red, blue and two green subpixels
- Higher resolution screens and more bits of colour = more RAM needed to render
- 256 x 256 x 256 = 16 million unique colours
- 8 bits per colour, considered 24 bit colour
- can be represented in decimal RGB (three values from 0 to 255)
- rgb example: 255, 209, 220 is light pink
- the same colour can also be represented hexadecimally as #FFD1DC
- sorry i didnt get into parts of the GPU its too much and personally idgaf
- an LCD is made up of a backlight, a polarizer, the pixels (cells) and colour filters
- active matrix lcd has one transistor for each cell in the lcd
- in active matrix, each pixel has a strong charge, but active matrix panels cost more to manufacture
- passive matrix panels have one transistor for each row of cells and uses a scan pattern to activate them, like an older crt monitor
- most lcds are active matrix
- OLED is a lot newer display technology, you see it really commonly on phones (iphones, higher end samsung phones, apple watches all use oled!)
- oled is more expensive and complex to manufacture than lcd but it has a lot of benefits
- unlike LCD which has a backlight, in an OLED every pixel is individually lit, meaning you get much better contrast and power efficiency
- (you get true blacks instead of dark gray, and by not having unused pixels lit, you save energy!)
