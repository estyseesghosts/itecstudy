ALU - Algorithmic Logic Unit 

CU - Control Unit 

The ALU, CLU and memory make up a CPU. The CPU also has some sort of I/O interface. 

Control unit controls instructions of running program, looks at program counter (PC / IP / instruction pointer) and determines the current or next instruction to be executed. 

A register is a slot of storage in the CPU for quick reference of relevant info. 

LMC calculator = accumulator, a type of register 

CPUs have a lot of registers to quickly store and manipulate data. 

Memory address register tells the CU where to look in memory, memory data register acts as a buffer and stores memory information while MAR is in use 

Busses send data between parts of the computer. A simplex bus is one-direction, a half-duplex is async bidirectional, a duplex is sync bidirectional 

1. **7.1**  What does *ALU* stand for? What is its corresponding component in the Little Man Computer? What does *CU* stand for? What is its corresponding LMC component?

- Algorithmic logic unit. Corresponds to the calculator.
- Control unit. Corresponds to the program counter.

2. **7.2**  What is a *register*? Be precise. Name at least two components in the LMC that meet
the qualifications for a register. Name several different kinds of values that a register
might hold.

- A register might hold data, program instructions, arithmetic instructions and results.
- The calculator and program counter are registers.

3. **7.3**  What is the purpose of the *instruction register*? What takes the place of the instruction
register in the LMC?

- The instruction register holds the instruction being run currently. The little man’s brain is essentially the instruction register.

4. **7.4**  When a value is copied from one register to another, what happens to the value in the
source register? What happens to the value in the destination register?

- The source register is untouched. The destination register is overwritten.

6. **7.6**  Explain the relationship between the memory address register, the memory data
register, and memory itself.

- The MAR holds the address of the data in memory to be processed.
- The MDR stores data from memory.
- Memory is fast storage a computer can read and write to to store relevant information.

7. **7.7**  If the memory register for a particular computer is 32 bits wide, how much memory
can this computer support?

- 4GB

8. **7.8**  What is the difference between volatile and nonvolatile memory? Is RAM volatile or
nonvolatile? Is ROM volatile or nonvolatile?

- Volatile memory is reset when it loses power, non-volatile memory is not. Volatile memory is faster. RAM is volatile, ROM is not.

9. **7.9**  Registers perform a very important role in the fetch–execute cycle. What is the function
of registers in the fetch–execute instruction cycle?

- Registers store the instructions the CPU is yet to run

1. **7.10**  Explain each step of the fetch part of the fetch–execute cycle. At the end of the
fetch operation, what is the status of the instruction? Specifically, what has the fetch
operation achieved that prepares the instruction for execution? Explain the similarity
between this operation and the corresponding operation-performed steps performed
by the Little Man.

- Move instruction from memory to the memory register
- Move the instruction from the memory register to the instruction register
- Run the instruction
- Information from a register address is copied into memory
- Commit the information from memory to a register
- Increment the program counter

5. **7.14**  Define a *bus*. What are buses used for?

- A bus carries information and power
- It can be electrical, optical, pretty much whatever

6. **7.15**  What three types of “data” might a bus carry?

- Instructions
- Addresses
- Numbers

7. **7.16**  Explain how data travels on a bus when the bus is

- *Simplex -* Unidirectional
- *Half-duplex -* Bidirectional, asynchronous 
*- Full-duplex -* Bidirectional, synchronous 

8. **7.17**  What is the difference between a *multipoint* bus and a *point-to-point* bus? Draw
diagrams that illustrate the difference.

- Point-to-point goes directly from one device to another.
- Multipoint takes multiple inputs or has multiple outputs.

9. **7.18**  Briefly describe each of the major disadvantages of parallel buses.

- Electrical interference, larger physical space, more costly to implement, worse throughput than serial

10. **7.19**  Which Little Man Computer instructions would be classified as *data movement* instructions?

- STO
- INP
- OUT

11. **7.20**  What operations would you expect the arithmetic class of instructions to perform?

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

12. **7.21**  Explain the difference between SHIFT and ROTATE instructions.

- SHIFT shifts the whole number left or right by one bit.
- ROTATE shifts the whole number left or right by one bit, but moves the bit that was “pushed off” to the other side.

13. **7.22**  What do *program control instructions* do? Which LMC instructions would be classified as program control instructions?

- Program control instructions control the flow of your program, including looping through instructions, breaking to run different segments of code
- LMC BRA, BRP and BRZ would be classified as program control instructions.

14. **7.23**  What is a stack? Explain how a stack works. Create a diagram that shows how PUSH and POP instructions are used to implement a stack.

- Stacks are collections of data when the most recently used data will be the first used. Last-in, first-out.

15. **7.24**  What is a *privileged instruction*? Which LMC instructions would normally be privileged?

- A privileged instruction can only be run by the operating system. HALT would typically be privileged on a real system.
