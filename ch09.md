Input - process - output model 

IO connects devices to the CPU and other parts of the system

Interfaces control IO instead of the CPU directly, for simplicity and modularity 

9.1 In terms of the nature of the data, how does a keyboard differ from a hard disk as an input device?

- Keyboards are slow, low bitrate, low bandwidth, uses smaller units of data.

9.2 Name at least two devices that can generate unexpected input.

- Mice
- Keyboards

9.3 Explain the purpose of a buffer.

- Holds data as it is available, releases data as possible

9.4 Explain the reasons why programmed I/O does not work very well when the I/O device is a hard disk or a graphics display.

- Programmed IO is slow and low bandwidth and wastes IPC

9.5 When an interrupt occurs, what happens to the program that is currently executing at the time?

- It runs its interrupt handler

9.6 What is a context? What does it contain? What is it used for?

- The context is where a program left off executing instructions, used to resume from that point after an interrupt.

9.7 The book lists four primary uses for interrupts. State and explain at least three of them.

- An event monitor - frees the cpu from having to poll for information
- As a completion signal - let the cpu know a task has finished
- Abnormal event indicator - something went wrong
- As a means of allocating cpu time - Let threads share the cpu

9.8 What kind of interrupt occurs when a user’s program tries to execute a privileged instruction?

- Illegal instruction

9.9 What does DMA stand for? What capability does DMA add to a computer?

- Direct memory access
- Lets the IO controller access the memory directly instead of having to go through the cpu, increasing speed and efficiency

9.10 What are the three primary conditions that are required for DMA to take place?

- IO and memory are directly connected
- IO controller can RW RAM
- There must be a safeguard so that the cpu and IO controller don’t RW the same block at the same time

9.11 What data must an I/O controller have before a DMA transfer takes place? How is this data sent to the controller?

- The location of the data on the IO device
- The starting location of the block in memory
- The size of the block
- Read or Write
- The CPU sends it to the controller

9.12 What is the purpose of a completion interrupt at the conclusion of a DMA transfer?

- To let the CPU know the transfer is done

9.13 A graphics card is an example of an I/O controller. I/O controllers have (at least) two interfaces. What are the two interfaces of a graphics card connected to?

- The CPU
- The display

9.14 Name at least three benefits that are provided by I/O controllers.

- Less strain on CPU
- More bandwidth
- Easier to program for
