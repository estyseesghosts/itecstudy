11.1 Explain what is meant by synergy.

- How well components are optimized and integrated with each other
- For example, in an apple soc, the CPU GPU and other components are purpose built for eachother, and the code is written specifically for that soc, this is a very high degree of synergy

11.2 What are the five basic hardware components that make up a computer?

- The CPU
- IO peripherals
- RAM
- IO controllers
- the busses that connect all of this together

11.3 What is the purpose of a bus interface or bus bridge?

- connects things together

11.4 Explain what you expect to find on a motherboard.

- CPU, RAM, IO controllers, northbridge and southbridge (may be integrated into cpu or other controllers), connectors for peripherals

11.5 What is the predominant master bus found on modern personal computers? What advantages does this bus offer over other buses?

- PCIe
- it’s fast as fuck boi
- parallel over multiple lanes so it’s insanely fast and efficient

11.6 What are major similarities and differences between the PCI-Express bus and the PCI bus?

- they both connect high speed devices like GPUs and NICs etc etc 
- pci is parallel, pcie is serial 

11.7 What are the advantages of USB3 as a means to connect peripheral devices to the computer?

- it’s fast and usb 4 is even faster
- it can transfer power
- it can interface through hubs ensuring that even if your computer doesnt have a lot of usb ports you can still connect all the devices you need

11.8 What is a topology? Describe the basic USB topology. Describe the basic Thunderbolt topology.

- USB: Devices connect to a hub, which connects to a root hub, which connects to the host controller in a computer
- Thunderbolt: Devices connect to each other as a chain, then connect to the thunderbolt controller which interfaces with the CPU

11.9 What are the advantages offered by I/O channel architecture, such as that used on mainframe computer systems, over bus architecture?

- The I/O channel architecture essentially offloads all IO operations to the controller as if it were a computer purpose-built for IO signalling, freeing the CPU from controlling IO entirely

11.10 What are the advantages of SoC over the traditional architectural layout of a motherboard? What type of computing devices benefit greatly from the incorporation of SoC?

- in an SOC everything is tightly integrated both physically and logically, so it’s insanely fast and efficient
- historically phones and tablets used SOCs because of efficiency, thermals and physical requirements
- apple is most notable for moving their laptops and desktops away from intel cpus to custom SOCs, and these apple laptops with SOCs have better thermals and power efficiency compared to the intel CPU machines they replaced
- desktops also benefit from SOCs because of size - with tightly integrated thermally efficient SOCs you can make much smaller desktop machines that fit on desks instead of large towers that go underneath
