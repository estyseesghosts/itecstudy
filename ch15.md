What is the primary concern of application architecture? Give an example of application architecture, either your own, or one from the examples in the book. Explain how this example fulfills the features and requirements of the concept of application architecture.

- The primary concern of appl. architecture is activities and processing of application systems and the communications with them, an example of this is a client server architecture

Most modern computing in organizations is based on client -server models. Explain why this tends to be the case. Give an example of client-server computing that you are familiar with and explain the characteristics of your example that fulfill the concept of client-server computing.

- Client presents data to the user, server processes the data and hands it off to the client
- More efficient use of resources, makes sure the processing isnt tied to the front-end presentation
- An example of this is a webapp where the client is a browser and the server is the host

Web-based system architecture is a popular approach to many organizational systems because it offers a number of advantages to the users and to the organization over other types of systems. Discuss the primary advantages to this approach

- all the work is done for you pretty much lol
- everything is accessible from anywhere you can have internet and a computer, not tied to onsite infra and storage

Many system architects base their IT system designs on an n-tier architecture, where n is a number with value 2 or greater. Explain the difference between a single-tier architecture and a n-tier architecture. What are the main advantages claimed for an n-tier architecture?

- modularity, each tier can be managed and upgraded independently
- reusability, components within a tier can be used within other parts of the system
- scalability, different tiers can be scaled independent of one another to improve efficiency and manage resources effectively
- flexibility, each part of the system can be modified independently to accommodate change in needs

What is a "loosely coupled" computer system? How does it differ from a "tightly coupled" system?

- each computer has its own complete facilities including cpu ram and storage, and are connected together by high speed links
- tightly coupled systems are computers with multiple CPUs that share the same ram and storage

Define cluster.

- a group of computers connected together to act as one

Briefly explain each of the four reasons for creating a cluster. Give an example of each reason if you can.

- increase computing power by having more cpus and ram available
- create more resilient systems, you can keep working if one blade goes down
- computers can be spread geographically so instead of having latency from connecting to one on another continent, you can connect to the cluster physically closest to you
- load balancing, spread work across all the blades instead of just one

What is a shared-nothing cluster?

- a shared-nothing cluster is a cluster that does not share any resources or storage, and is merely computers linked together to do tasks together

Explain cloud computing in simple terms. Briefly discuss the major advantages and risks to an organization when considering the adoption of cloud computing.

- offload your stuff to someone elses computer
- advantages: dont need to build infra in house, dont need physical computers because its all running on someone elses machine, pretty cheap and very flexible
- disadvantages: you dont own the infra you’re using, you don’t have ownership of the disks hosting your data and machines running your code, if the host goes down they take you down with them

Explain the difference between a multi-cloud and a hybrid cloud.

- a multi-cloud is a network that uses multiple cloud service providers to increase resiliency in case one of them has issues
- a hybrid cloud is a network that uses both off-site cloud providers like aws azure etc and internally hosted private cloud infrastructure

Give a simple explanation and example for SaaS. Do the same for PaaS. Do the same for IaaS.

- SaaS - software as a service, software you pay a subscription for instead of buying to own
- Example being adobe creative cloud
- PaaS - platform as a service, lets entities run programs and compute things without having their own infra for it
- example being amazon web services
- IaaS - infrastructure as a service, pay someone else to host your mission critical data and computers and vms etc etc
- example being azure, aws, google cloud

Explain the differences and similarities between DaaS and PaaS.

- DaaS is a desktop as a service, literally you are renting someone elses hardware and using it over the internet
- PaaS is platform as a service, you use it to run and store mission critical software
- DaaS you interact with directly as if it was your own computer, with gui and programs and everything
- PaaS you generally manage through a web console or through terminal ssh

Explain grid computing.

- offload your work to other peoples computers
- basically have a shit mega fuck ton of other peoples computers doing calculations and stuff in the background when they arent being used by someone
- like a botnet but its for Good and its consensual
