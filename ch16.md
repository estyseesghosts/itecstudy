16.1 The definition of an operating system specifies two primary purposes served by the operating system. What are they?

- Integrate the hardware resources of the computer
- Make them available to the user and their software

16.2 Explain the major error in the following sentence: "One of the major tasks performed by the operating system program is to load and execute programs."

- The operating system program is responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of all programs running on a computer, including the loading and execution of other programs, but it is not the only program capable of performing these tasks.

16.3 Explain concurrent processing. Briefly describe at least two services that an operating system must provide to support concurrent processing.

- Concurrent processing, also known as multitasking is the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This improves the overall performance and responsiveness of a computer.

16.4 What are the memory resident parts of an operating system called? When are these parts loaded into memory?

- Loaded into memory when the OS is booting.

16.5 What is a diskless workstation or thin client?

- It’s a kind of extremely barebones computer that’s purpose built to stream software over the internet

16.6 What does API stand for? What is the purpose of an API?

- Application programming interface
- Helps different software interface with eachother, transmit data, and communicate

16.7 Operating systems are said to be event driven. Explain what this means.

- OS generally stands idle until an event takes place.

16.8 What is the difference between multiprogramming and multiprocessing?

- Multiprogramming is the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks concurrently, using a single CPU core.
- Multiprocessing achieves the same thing but with multiple CPU cores.

16.9 Explain dispatching. Describe the two basic methods that are used by operating systems to implement dispatching.

- Dispatching is the process of selecting a task from a queue of pending tasks and allocating the CPU to execute it.
- Preemptive dispatching: A method in which the operating system kernel can interrupt a running task and preempt its execution in order to allocate the CPU to a different task.
- Non-preemptive dispatching: A method in which the operating system kernel allows a running task to run until it completes or voluntarily yields the CPU.

16.10 What tasks are performed by device drivers?

- Control various hardware devices such as disk drives or network cards
- Essential for operating systems to interact with these devices and to provide necessary services to programs.
- Translates commands from the operating system into instructions that the hardware device can understand.
- Providing a standard interface that allows different programs to access the hardware device in a consistent manner.
- Monitoring the state of the hardware device and generating events or notifications when something changes.

16.11 The basic role of a file management system is to provide a mapping service. Between what and what?

- The logical storage needs of files and the physical locations of the data on the storage device.

16.12 Briefly describe at least three of the four major services provided by a file management system.

- Directory structures for each I/O device in the system and tools to access and move them around
- Tools that copy and move I/O files to another and from one directory to another and other basic file manipulation.
- Information of these files and tools to access the information.

16.13 Explain the concept of a process. How does a process differ from a program?

- A process is an instance of a program that is executing on a computer.
- A program is a static entity that exists as a set of instructions stored on a storage device.
- A process is a dynamic entity that exists in memory while it is executing.
- A program is typically executed by loading it into memory and starting it at a specific entry point.
- A process may be created and terminated multiple times during the execution of a program.
- A program is typically executed as a single, sequential sequence of instructions.
- A process may be executed concurrently with other processes, allowing the operating system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

16.14. Describe at least two primary tasks performed by the memory management component of an operating system.

- Allocating and deallocating memory to processes as needed.
- Enforcing memory protection policies to ensure that each process has access only to the memory it is allowed to access

16.15 Explain what is meant by preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling.

- In preemptive scheduling, the operating system has the ability to interrupt a running process and temporarily suspend its execution in order to run another process
- In nonpreemptive scheduling, once a process begins running, it continues to run until it either finishes or voluntarily yields control of the CPU to another process

16.16 Identify at least four different tasks performed by a sysadmin.

- A sysadmin, or system administrator, is responsible for maintaining and managing a computer system or network. Some of the tasks that a sysadmin might perform include:
- Installing, configuring, and updating the operating system and other software on the system.
- Managing user accounts and permissions, including creating new accounts, setting password policies, and assigning access levels to users.
- Monitoring the system to ensure that it is running efficiently and reliably, and troubleshooting and resolving any issues that arise.
- Backing up and restoring data, to protect against data loss in case of system failure or other disasters.

16.17 What is true of system administration on small personal computers that is usually not true of larger systems or of personal computers within an organization?

- On small personal computers, it is common for the user of the computer to also be the sysadmin. This is because the user typically has full control over the computer, and can make all necessary changes and configurations without needing the assistance of a separate sysadmin.
- On larger systems or within an organization, it is more common for there to be a separate team of sysadmins who are responsible for managing the system or network, as it is not practical for individual users to manage the system themselves.

16.18 What is the purpose of system generation?

- The purpose of system generation is to create a new, working version of an operating system.

16.19 The UNIX kernel is described as a monolithic organization. What does this mean? What are the maior challenges presented by a monolithic organization?

- A monolithic kernel is a design in which the entire kernel is a single, unified program.
- This can make the kernel large and complex, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain.
- A monolithic kernel can be less flexible and efficient than a modular kernel.
- Some challenges of a monolithic kernel include difficulty adding new features and fixing bugs, and potentially reduced performance and adaptability.

16.20 Describe the organization of a hierarchically structured operating system.

- Lowest level: Hardware, which provides the basic physical and electrical components of the computer.
- Above Hardware: The Kernel, which is the core of the operating system and provides the basic services and functions that other parts of the operating system and user programs can use.
- Above Kernel: Specialized services such as device drivers, APIs and system libraries
- Top level: User programs, which are the programs that users run directly, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.

16.21 How do real-time systems differ from other tvpes of operating svstems?

- Real-time systems are operating systems that are designed to provide timely and predictable responses to events and inputs.
- Real-time systems are often used in applications where quick and accurate responses are critical, such as in process control and robotics.
- Real-time systems may have more stringent requirements for performance, reliability, and predictability than other operating systems.
- Real-time systems may need to handle a greater degree of uncertainty and variability than other operating systems.
- The key difference between real-time systems and other operating systems is that real-time systems are designed to provide timely and predictable responses, whereas other operating systems may prioritize other factors.
